# auth package · auth

Import path: `github.com/looprig/inference/auth`. Package auth provides access to user-provided authentication credentials.

## Package role {#package-role}

This page indexes the exported declarations in the current source package. Inference `v0.9.2` keeps model descriptors, request and response values, codec contracts, streams, retries, and gateway behavior independent of provider credentials.

## Exported surface {#exported-surface}

The names below are the exported functions, methods, types, constants, and variables returned by the source package documentation.

### Functions and methods {#functions-and-methods}

`AddCredentials`

### Types {#types}

None reported.

### Constants and variables {#constants-and-variables}

None reported.

## Ownership and errors {#ownership-and-errors}

The auth package exposes `AddCredentials` as its main operations. No package-specific error type is exported here; use the owning contract or helper return error rather than parsing diagnostic text. Retries do not replay a stream after output has started.

## Source and runnable proof {#source-and-runnable-proof}

Read the [package source](https://github.com/looprig/inference/tree/v0.9.2/auth/) and adjacent tests. The progressive entries `stage-01-inference`, `stage-02-streaming`, `stage-22-model-gateway` cover deterministic invoke, stream, and gateway paths; run them with `node scripts/docs/run-examples.mjs`. The release proof pins the module tag only; Task15 should promote declaration and adjacent-test evidence from this package path. Draft proof: `release-github-com-looprig-inference`.
